      <h3>
        Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from UT coding bootcamp with a
        strong background in surgical services and anesthesia. Coding skills in
        HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Node,
        Express, React, MongoDB, MySql, Sequelize, Git, and Linux commands. I
        have 20 years of experience in Surgery as a Certified Anesthesia
        Technician. My medical background will help me with web development
        because surgery is a fast-paced, time-sensitive environment with little
        room for error. Learning new processes and working with new technologies
        is taught with a ‘see one, do one, teach one’ mentality in surgery,
        helping me retain information through doing and teaching while still
        learning. Working closely with a team to maintain a clean and efficient
        workspace has taught me team-work, collaboration, and compromise. As a
        technician, I keep the anesthesia machines and devices in safe, working
        order. Keeping organized logs of all maintenance and safety checks that
        are performed and when they are due.{' '}
